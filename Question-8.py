# Write a python script to check if a string contains only numbers.

string = input("Enter a string: ")

print(string.isdigit())     # Here it represents (0-9) only and nothing else
print(string.isnumeric())   #It represents everthing based on digits like symbols 

# For understanding enter this in input Â½ and see the answer
